A sample project which is showing an implementation of CRC algorithm.

The CRC tables are being generated through a C++ templates.
This method gave me a shortest code, but not of a good readability though.
Nevertheless here are also included other samples on how to generate a CRC, including bit-by-bit one.

Look "docs/implementations.txt" for the project map.
