
That isn't vital, but for a newer MSVC you may want to enable a switch so that the templates would be compiled more appropriately: "/Zc:__cplusplus".
Configuration Properties -> C/C++ > Command Line property page -> Additional options
This option requres Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7.

MSVC 2008, beginning from version 05 of this project, actually doesn't cope with this code anymore :)
It yet can compile, but with warnings. Sometimes with errors (need to rebuild the solution then, or delete "crc_test.bsc" file and then link). Those templates unroll to something big.

Tested also on Code::Blocks 13320 with MinGW64 GCC 13.1.0 compiler.

It will not work on MSVC 6.0 or 2002.
Compiles and works on MSVC 2003, MSVC 2005 Express, MSVC 2015.

MSVCs 2003 and 2005 compile it even without a warning, but for 2008 and 2015 you may want to either turn off "Enable Browse Information", or exclude some of template-based CRCs: when them are only one, no warning is being thrown.
The other option would be to break "crc_table_gen.h" onto parts. But that file is already small, and do something because of a weakness of a compiler isn't rational.
